# Portfolio

## Description

I created my very first portfolio web application which consists of three sections on a single page: about me, my works, and contact. 

- About: You can see a short description of me including my profile picutre and download the Resume file.
- Work: I added a refactored project last week, the rest will be added later.
- Contact: I put a link on the contact so you can email me or you can reach out to me via the social media icon in the footer.

## Usage
Live application deployed at: https://oliviasylee.github.io/portfolio/ <br><br>
