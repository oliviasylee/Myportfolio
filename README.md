# Portfolio

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I created my very first portfolio web application. My portfolio is divided into 3 sections on one page - about me, my works, and contact. I was inspired by several portfolio references, including html and css I learned in class.

- About: You can see a short description of me including my profile picutre and download the Resume file.
- Work: I added a refactored project last week, the rest will be added later.
- Contact: I put a link on the contact so you can email me or you can reach out to me via the social media icon in the footer.

There is one problem that I haven't solved yet. It is a responsive design. The navigation and main section should change according to the screen size, but I will definitely fix it. - **Almost Fixed**
