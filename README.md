# My Portfolio

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I created my very first portfolio web application. 
My portfolio is divided into 3 sections on one page - about me, my works, and contact. I was inspired by several portfolio references, including html and css I learned in class.
- About: You can see a short description of me including my profile picutre and download the Resume file.
- Work: I added a refactored project last week, the rest will be added later.
- Contact: I have put a link on the contact so you can email me or you can reach out to me via the social media icon in the 

I've tried this and that, but there is one problem that I haven't solved yet. It is a responsive design. The navigation and main section should change according to the screen size, but I haven't solved it yet. But I will definitely fix it!
